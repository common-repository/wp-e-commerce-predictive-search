Now you can 100% accurately Optimize your entire site anyway you want with WP e-Commerce Predictive Search 'Focus Keywords' and Optimize your 'site search' by adding a 'Focus Keywords or Keyword Phrases' to any product page, post, wp-page just like an SEO plugin except it is for site search not external search engines and its 100% accurate and super fast.

* Feature - Integration with SEO plugins. Can be a massive time saver. Configure your plugin with the click of a mouse to use Focus Keywords that are set on an SEO plugin you are using. Added the ability for to also include any 'Focus Keywords' that have been set while optimizing the site content for search engine search.  
* Feature - Currently supports * Yoasts WordPress SEO and the * All in One SEO plugins. We have built this feature so we can add any SEO plugin that uses 'Focus Keywords'. If you use another WordPress SEO Plugin and would like to see it included in the list of supported plugins please just let us know and we will look in including support for it in future updates.
* Feature - Added Pretty URL' support to replace the All Search Results pages parameter driven URLS
* Feature - Added the ability to add text content that shows inside the Search box. Added as a Global setting or can be individually set on Widgets, Shortcode or the Search Function
* Feature - All Results search page shortcode now shows as an image in the Search results page Visual text editor instead of the shortcode [ecommerce_search]. We have used an image to overcome some confusion about if the shortcode was a3rev Predictive Search or a WP e-Commerce shortcode function. Also has instructions (in English) about moving the shortcode to another page. After you upgrade, take a look.
* Feature - Exclude any product, post or page from Predictive Search results right from the Predictive Search Meta. Also see if it is currently excluded from search results, make it visible from the meta box.
* Feature - Major UI upgrade. We have completely rewritten the plugins admin panel and the Predictive Search tab on the WP e-Commerce > Store settings. Content is now broken into sub nav tabs for ease of use. The tabs are  Predictive Search | All Results Search Pages | Exclude Content | Search Function, with styling to be added in the next feature upgrade.
* Feature - Added a new Chosen styling lib for drop-downs and Options. This was important because it now makes excluding content a very easy thing to do for each content search taxonomy.
* Feature - Added when install and activate plugin link redirects to License Key validation page instead of the wp-plugins dashboard.
* Tweak - Updated admin error message that displays when plugin cannot connect to a3API on the Amazon cloud upon activation of the license.
* Tweak - Jumped version from 1.1.5 to 2.0 in line with this major rework and feature upgrade.
* Tweak - Updated plugin wiki docs to include new features and admin dashboard layout features.
* Fix - Sort Search Results Pages show 'No Results' - The way the plugin was configured when a user hit 'Enter' while searching all of the Search Results pages where displayed for Sorting - Sort by Product Name | SKU | Product Categories | Product Tags | Posts | Pages - All of the Tabs showed even if a page had 'No Results'. This was done to save on database queries. We have written a special script and added it is fired when the user clicks 'Enter' while searching - it checks each page for results - if it finds 'No Results' it hides the Page tab and if it finds results if does nothing, when it is finished doing the 6 queries it goes back to sleep. The result is only 6 extra queries being done and super fast and only shows pages that have results.
* Fix - Made new ajax filters to stop plugins like Role Scoper filtering predictive search functions.
* Fix - Posts that do not have any meta data not showing in search results.
* Fix - Don't show [shortcodes] in search results descriptions.
* Fix - Updated all Javascript functions so that the plugin is compatible with jQuery Version1.9 and backwards to version 1.6. WordPress still uses jQuery version 1.8.3. In themes that use Google js Library instead of the WordPress jQuery then there was trouble because Google uses the latest jQuery version 1.9. There are a number of functions in jQuery Version 1.9 that have been depreciated and hence this was causing errors with the jQuery function in the plugin.
* Fix - Link from search box drop down footer to All Results Search pages not working in Internet Explorer 8, 9 and 10.
* Fix - All Results pages returning a 404 page not found when custom permalinks set with a trailing slash. When a sites custom permalinks where set with a trailing slash this caused an extra / in the Results Search pages URL resulting in a 404. The plugin now checks if the trailing slash is present and allows for that to produce the correct URL. 
* Fix - Bug for users who have https: (SSL) on their sites wp-admin but have http on sites front end. This was causing search results to show a -1 in the drop down instead of the results because wp-admin with SSL applied only allows https:, but the url of admin-ajax.php is http: and it is denied hence returning the ajax -1 error. Fixed by writing a filter to recognize when https is configured on wp-admin and parsing correctly. If you do not have this configuration nothing changes for you, if you do have https on your wp-admin (or install it in the future) and http on the front end then Predictive Search now automatically detects that and works as it should.
* Fix - Search function and shortcodes not working on themes that call the wpautop function before the shortcode function (very poor practice). The wpautop function auto adds the <p> tag to all white space in php functions and thus breaks our function. We use internal script rather than a js file for the search function and shortcodes because a js file is always called on each page load even when it is not required. We have removed all white spaces and problem no longer exists.
* Fix - Undefined variable mediumSRC notice showing in search box dropdown when product does not have a featured image.We fixed by defining the variable.
* Fix - Full WP_DEG run. All Uncaught exceptions fixed.

= 1.1.5 - 2012/12/31 =
* Tweak - Updated plugin API to allow Pro Version License holders to manage their Licenses from the all new "My Account" dashboard on a3rev.

* Tweak - Added get Product Name results character description from Products 'Additional Description' if no content is entered for Product description.

* Feature: Now supports WPMU - Pro Version Single License now works on any domain or sub domain that the Plugin is installed on with the WPMU environment.
